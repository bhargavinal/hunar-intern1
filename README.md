# Task 1: Deploy a Static Website Using Cloudflare

## Project Overview
This project is part of my Hunar internship. The objective is to deploy a simple static website using **Cloudflare Pages** to understand how to host static files on the web efficiently and securely.

The website includes:
- An HTML page for structure.
- A CSS file for styling.
- A JavaScript file for interactivity.



## Features
- **Static Website**: A simple and user-friendly website that includes:
  - A welcoming message.
  - A clickable button that shows an alert.
- **Responsive Design**: The website is styled to look good on all devices.
- **Deployed on Cloudflare Pages**: Utilizes Cloudflare's free hosting services for deployment.

## Files in the Repository
1. **index.html**: The main HTML file that serves as the backbone of the website.
2. **styles.css**: The CSS file that defines the look and feel of the website.
3. **script.js**: A JavaScript file to handle user interactions.

## How to Access the Website
The deployed website is hosted on Cloudflare Pages. You can view it at the following URL:
